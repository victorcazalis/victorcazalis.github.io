# How can I support your projects?

## Online databases
I can help access and use data from online databases on biodiversity or habitat. I can access data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), [OBIS](https://obis.org/), [eBird](https://ebird.org), or [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) to gather information on a given site (e.g., which species have been observed within a given protected area) or a given species (e.g., where a given species has been observed). I can also access and process different habitat layers to get context information on the sites you are working on: [land-cover](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover), [forest cover](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change), [human density](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_pop.php), [road density](https://www.globio.info/download-grip-dataset), protected areas, and so on.

> You are a protected area and want a list of species found within your border -> I can extract data from GBIF (or other databases) and give you a spreadsheet with species name, number of occurrences, site, and even raw data.

> You are working on an invasive species -> I can extract data from online databases to enable you mapping and analysing the distribution and spread of your species. 



## Interactive data visualisation



## Maps and graphics
Combining R and Inkscape, I create maps and graphics to display results in a pretty and informative ways. This was actually my favourite part when writing papers so I can help you present your data in maps and graphics. Here are a few examples of graphical outputs from my research projects:

> You are running a conservation program and need to present the trends of your species in a report or website -> I can analyse the data and display the results nicely.

> You need a pretty and informative map of your protected area (including some graphics and pictures) -> I can design it for you.


## GIS analyses



## Statistical analyses
Over my years in academia I gained expertise in diverse statistical analyses. I can help you explore your data, find the correct statistical analyses to implement, and code the analyses.

I can for instance help with:
- Generalised Linear Models
- Mixed effect models
- Multivariate analyses (PCAs, factorial analyses...)
- Random Forest algorithms



## Database management
I can help you to create or manage a biodiversity database for your structure. I can help design the structure, code ways to populate the database, code ways to review the database and spot possible errors, or code ways to access and use data from it.

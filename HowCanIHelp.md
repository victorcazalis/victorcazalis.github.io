# How can I support your projects?

## Statistical analyses
Over my years in academia I gained expertise in diverse statistical analyses. I can help you explore your data, find the correct statistical analyses to implement, and code the analyses.

I can for instance help with:
- Generalised Linear Models
- Mixed effect models
- Multivariate analyses (PCAs, factorial analyses...)
- Random Forest algorithms


## GIS analyses


## Online databases
I can help access and use data from online databases on biodiversity or habitat. I can access data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), [OBIS](https://obis.org/), [eBird](https://ebird.org), or [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) to gather information on a given site (e.g., which species have been observed within a given protected area) or a given species (e.g., where a given species has been observed). I can also access and process different habitat layers to get context information on the sites you are working on: [land-cover](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover), [forest cover](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change), [human density](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_pop.php), [road density](https://www.globio.info/download-grip-dataset), protected areas, and so on.

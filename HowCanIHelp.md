# How can I support your projects?
Here are some ideas of what type of services I can provide (always with some concrete examples in grey). These are just ideas and you can combine them all together (e.g., using online databases, processing them in a GIS analyses, and display the result interactively) and many more things are possible. If you have a particular need and are unsure whether I can do it, just ask me via email!

## Online databases
I can help access and use data from online databases on biodiversity or habitat. I can access data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), [OBIS](https://obis.org/), [eBird](https://ebird.org), or [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) to gather information on a given site (e.g., which species have been observed within a given protected area) or a given species (e.g., where a given species has been observed). I can also access and process different habitat layers to get context information on the sites you are working on: [land-cover](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover), [forest cover](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change), [human density](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_pop.php), [road density](https://www.globio.info/download-grip-dataset), protected areas, and so on.

> You are a protected area and want a list of species found within your border → I can extract data from GBIF (or other databases) and give you a spreadsheet with species name, number of occurrences, site, and additional information.

> You are working on an invasive species → I can extract data from online databases to enable you mapping and analysing the distribution and spread of your species. 



## Interactive data visualisation
Interactive data visualisation is probably the best way to make informed decision in conservation. Being able to explore a map, click on a given sites to see the species occurring there, or clicking on a given species to understand its conservation needs will help you prioritise your actions. A big asset of interactive data visualisation is also that it is a good communication tool with people with little to no scientific background. The two main interactive tools I use are interactive reports and interactive apps.

## Maps and graphics
Combining R and Inkscape, I create maps and graphics to display results in a pretty and informative ways. This was actually my favourite part when writing papers so I can help you present your data in maps and graphics. Here are a few examples of graphical outputs from my research projects:

> You are running a conservation program and need to present the trends of your species in a report or website → I can analyse the data and display the results nicely.

> You need a pretty and informative map of your protected area (including some graphics and pictures) → I can design it for you.


## GIS analyses
Each of my research project included some GIS analyses. I run any GIS analysis in R, which enables to process large datasets in a standard and reproducible way. I can then develop R codes to do anything you need with polygon and rasters data. For instance, I can run any of the following analyses and use the results in any statistical analysis or data visualisation possible:
- assign point data to different polygons (e.g., to identify in which "region" falls each point)
- intersect different polygons (e.g., to identify the different protected areas overlapping with a given polygon)
- calculate raster values within different polygons (e.g., to calculate forest cover trends within each protected area)
- create polygons from points (e.g., to map the distribution of a given species)
- calculate distance between polygons and raster values (e.g., to calculate the distance from any point or polygon to the closest human settlement)
- create rasters (e.g., transforming a polygon map of lakes in a region to a raster of distance to lakes)
You can see more options of what is possible for instance in the R sf [cheatsheet](https://www.comeetie.fr/cours/DU/dsp5/sf-cheatsheet.pdf). 

> You need to calculate different characteristics of the lakes across your protected area → I can calculate multiple characteristics for each lake (e.g., size, elevation, forest cover, distance to human activities, level of protection, number of species recorded in a buffer of 5 km...).

> You are working on a restoration project and need to identify 10 sites in a given region where to prioritize your efforts → I can use geographical data on species distribution, habitat, human pressure, and protection to identify sites that would be the best suited for restoration efforts.

## Statistical analyses
Over my years in academia I gained expertise in diverse statistical analyses. I can help you explore your data, find the correct statistical analyses to implement, and code the analyses.

I can for instance help with:
- Generalised Linear Models
- Mixed effect models
- Distance sampling and site occupancy models
- Multivariate analyses (PCAs, factorial analyses...)
- Random Forest algorithms

> You are monitoring a species within your region → I can analyse your raw data to estimate population trends.

> You need to identify if a given factor is influencing the occurrence of your target species → I can use site occupancy models to answer your question.


## Database management
I can help you to create or manage a biodiversity database for your structure. I can help design the structure, code ways to populate the database, code ways to review the database and spot possible errors, or code ways to access and use data from it.

> You have many observation from our structure that are difficult to access and use → I can merge them in a standard dataset that will be easy to use.

> You have an old database that needs to be filtered and transform → I can address the problems your current database has (e.g., identify data with wrong coordinates, harmonise species names...) and transform it to a clean dataset.

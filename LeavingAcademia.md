## Leaving academia

In January 2023, I left academia to work on global conservation from a different perspective.

Since I started my Bachelor in ecology, I have been obsessed with the idea to do conservation science that would be both global and very applied. In my PhD, I explored how research could deliver message to policy makers (e.g., international agreements on protected areas are not met), while during my postdoc as explored how research could support key conservation institutions (e.g., how can we fasten Red List assessment process). Both experiences drove me to the same conclusion: research is not applied enough for me. I believed for many years that I could do research differently and meet the dream vision that I have of an applied research; I now think conversely, that conservation science is relying too much on research effort, which is not the most effective community to achieve applied goals.

Blockage in research: Writing papers = driven by novelty and not usefulness / saying something rather than doing it / often stops at publication

All I find useful is what is around research (outreach / providing tools to access research results / XX) - but maybe NGO are more suited to do that than researchers

The idea behind conservara (support NGOs rather than taking their space)

Eventually, I am planning to change career to become a primary school teacher, which I think will be facinating and fun, but I will first see what can be achieved with the idea behind Conservara.

I am a French Conservation Biology scientist, with particular interests in international conservation, conservation effectiveness, IUCN Red List and birds. After five years in academia, I decided to step aside (see [Leaving Academia](http://conservara.fr/LeavingAcademia) and explore how to increase the uptake of research by offering NGOs, researchers, and media analyses services to make research methods accessible to them (see [Conservara](http://conservara.fr/Conservara)).

Feb.2023 - now: **Selt-employment at Conservara** - Conservation Analyst for Research Application (discover [Conservara](http://conservara.fr/Conservara)).

Feb.2021 - Jan.2023: **Post-Doc position** at [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/en/sdiv.html), working in the [sRedList project](https://www.idiv.de/en/sredlist.html) to develop an innovative and consistent framework for prioritising the updates of Red List assessments. This project is led by [Luca Santini](http://lucasantini.com/) and [Moreno Di Marco](https://www.biodiversitychange.com).

Oct.2017 - Nov.2020: **PhD student** at the [Centre for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology (CEFE)](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) in Montpellier, working with [Ana S.L. Rodrigues](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/dpb/862-c/228-ana-rodrigues) on protected area effectiveness. I graduated on the 9th of November 2020 and my PhD thesis (partly in French) can be found [here](http://theses.fr/2020MONTG019/document).

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy hiking and birding (especially in the mountains), playing music (double bass and piano) or handcrafting stuff.

More detail can be found in my [CV](/CV.pdf) (last update January 2022).
